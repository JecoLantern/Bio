    <p>My name is Jeric, I live in Roseville, CA. I studied Medical Laboratory Science for 4 years and got a degree out of it. I got my California Clinical Laboratory License in 2013 and currently working in a reference laboratory for the past 5 years. I do testing for patient samples including but not limited to poo, pee and blood. The Test Results I release aid the physician in the diagnosis and in the treatment of diseases as well as to promote long life</p>
